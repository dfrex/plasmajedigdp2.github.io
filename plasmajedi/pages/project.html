				The Project

				The lightsaber, the weapon of a Jedi, is not only the dream of Star Was fans, also the dream of plasma scientists. In this project, we will build a real-life lightsaber using non-thermal atmospheric plasma (NTP) technology to sterilise wounds and surgical equipment for future manned space exploration missions. A non-thermal atmospheric plasma, which can operate at room temperature, has attracted considerable attention in recent years due to its extraordinary and unique antibacterial effects. The unique antibacterial and chemical activity of NTP makes it as an ideal tool to fight bacteria during future space missions.

			<p class="text-body">
				The sanitisation of spacecraft and astronauts is one of the largest biological challenges for interplanetary spaceflight. The modules on the ISS are not immune to microorganisms, and long-duration missions to other celestial bodies will have to consider the shelf life of antibiotics and other drugs as there is great concern that microorganisms attached to or inside a spacecraft could arrive at extra-terrestrial destinations without appropriate sterilisation. Therefore, the portable non-thermal plasma jet, a miniaturised lightsaber, could aid future space exploration missions in this regard due to its exceptional sterilising capabilities.

				For this project, the team will design and build a portable non-thermal plasma jet which can generate at least a 5cm long plasma jet using the ‘CeraPlas’ cold plasma generator that has been generously donated by TDK Electronic. This project is to achieve 4 aims comprising:
			</p>
			<p class="text-list">
				&#9642; Design and testing of a battery powered non-thermal plasma ignition system<br>
				&#9642; Design and manufacture of a miniaturised mass flow control system<br>
				&#9642; Design and analysis of a nozzle to form the non-thermal plasma jet<br>
				&#9642; Performance analysis of the assembled non-thermal plasma jet device
